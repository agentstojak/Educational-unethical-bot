# Educational-unethical-bot


Welcome to the Educational-Unethical-Bot project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the boundaries of AI unethics through creative and sometimes unorthodox means. We've gathered a diverse set of models, each with its unique capabilities, to push the limits of what's possible within the AI landscape. 🌟

# Models Used 🔧
Google Gemini: Known for its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities, Gemini brings a robust foundation to our experiments. 📚
v0: This model offers a fresh perspective with its innovative approach to natural language processing, adding a layer of creativity to our projects. 🎨
ChatGPT: A staple in the AI community, ChatGPT provides a reliable and versatile tool for a wide range of applications, from simple queries to complex conversations. 🗣️
DeepSeek: With its deep learning prowess, DeepSeek enhances our ability to delve into intricate data patterns and generate insightful outputs. 🔍
GitHub Copilot: As an AI pair programmer, Copilot assists in writing code, making our development process more efficient and innovative. 💻

# Purpose 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to have fun while exploring the capabilities and limitations of different AI models. By experimenting with various prompts and techniques, we aim to bypass conventional filters and uncover new possibilities. This repository serves as a playground for those interested in the intersection of creativity, technology, and ethics. 🧪

# How to Use 🛠️
Using this is pretty simple, you first need to download the file and then go to the 37th line and input your Discord Bot Token(https://unified.to/blog/how_to_get_your_discord_oauth_2_credentials_and_bot_token) also you need to then invite the bot to the server(https://help.pebblehost.com/en/discord-bot-hosting/how-to-invite-your-bot-to-a-discord-server). After that you need to only run your code inside your code editor that you use, after that head into discord and go to the server where you invited your bot. The bot should be online if you did everything correct and after that type ?help inside a channel and the bot should respond with all available commands. 🤖
